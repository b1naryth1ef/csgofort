# CSGO Fort
CSGO Fort is an ambitious project to create a central portal for trading, betting, and market analytics around Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. It's goal is to foster an open-source community around most, if not all, of these projects.

## Maz (Market Analytics)
Maz is the portal for extensive Steam Community Market analytics and stats. At it's core is an intelligent market crawler which regularly polls for pricing and item data from the Steam website. Maz also provides a simple frontend to viewing and aggregating this data, and a extensive backend API for those that want to plug into the stored data. Maz is currently in development.

## Trade (Item Trading)
Trade is a portal for smart, easy, and player-friendly trading. It was built from frustrations developed over using multiple other trading sites, and attempts to be a good middle ground for traders. Trade is currently in the initial planning and design stages.
