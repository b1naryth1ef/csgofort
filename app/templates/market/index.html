                Welcome to the CSGO Fort Market! Here you can dive into a deep set of crawled market data from the Steam Community Market. The Fort Market provides you with an extensive tool set for querying and analysing all of our historical and analytical data. Along with a public interface, the Fort Market also has a backend API that can be plugged into to get even more data and information, without having to write your own custom Steam Market crawlers.
